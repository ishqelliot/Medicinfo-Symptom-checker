(1, 'A number of different disorders may affect the hands or fingers, including ganglia, deformities, disorders related to nerves or blood vessels, osteoarthritis, trigger finger, and infections. Some other disorders that affect the hands are covered elsewhere in the book, including fractures, other injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, tendinitis and tenosynovitis, de Quervain syndrome, Raynaud syndrome, finger clubbing, and certain birth defects.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<span id=''heading''>Hand and finger deformities</span><br/>\r\nHand and finger deformities include swan-neck deformity, boutonnière deformity, and Dupuytren contracture. These deformities may be caused by an injury or may result from another disorder (for example, rheumatoid arthritis—see see Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)). Typically, doctors base the diagnosis on an examination. Deformities can sometimes be treated by splinting or exercises, but if the deformity has lasted for weeks or months, these treatments may be ineffective because scarring has developed.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<span id=''heading''>Nerve compression syndromes</span><br/>\r\nCarpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, and radial tunnel syndrome are nerve compression syndromes. In these disorders, something (usually bone or connective tissue) presses on a nerve, causing abnormalities of sensation, movement, or both. Symptoms include tingling, pain, loss of sensation, weakness, or a combination. The diagnosis is suggested by the examination and can be confirmed by electromyography and nerve conduction studies. In these syndromes, surgery may be necessary to relieve pressure on the nerve if symptoms are severe despite other treatments or if there is persistent loss of sensation or weakness.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<span id=''heading''>Hand and finger infections</span><br/>\r\nHuman and animal bites can cause an infection of the hands. Some other infections are felon, herpetic whitlow, hand abscess, and infection of the tendon sheath. Hand and finger infections can cause constant, intense, throbbing pain. Doctors base the diagnosis on an examination and sometimes x-rays. These infections are treated with antibiotics taken by mouth or by vein and surgery.'),
(2, 'What most people call the shoulder is really several joints that combine with tendons and muscles to allow a wide range of motion in the arm — from scratching your back to throwing the perfect pitch.<br/>\r\n\r\nMobility has its price, however. It may lead to increasing problems with instability or impingement of the soft tissue or bony structures in your shoulder, resulting in pain. You may feel pain only when you move your shoulder, or all of the time. The pain may be temporary or it may continue and require medical diagnosis and treatment.\r\n<br/>\r\nThis article explains some of the common causes of shoulder pain, as well as some general treatment options. Your doctor can give you more detailed information about your shoulder pain.<br/>\r\nMost shoulder problems fall into four major categories:\r\n<br/>\r\nTendon inflammation (bursitis or tendinitis) or tendon tear<br/>\r\nInstability<br/>\r\nArthritis<br/>\r\nFracture (broken bone)<br/>\r\nOther much less common causes of shoulder pain are tumors, infection, and nerve-related problems.<br/>\r\n<span id=''heading''>Arthritis</span><br/>\r\nShoulder pain can also result from arthritis. There are many types of arthritis. The most common type of arthritis in the shoulder is osteoarthritis, also known as "wear and tear" arthritis. Symptoms, such as swelling, pain, and stiffness, typically begin during middle age. Osteoarthritis develops slowly and the pain it causes worsens over time.\r\n<br/>\r\nOsteoarthritis, may be related to sports or work injuries and chronic wear and tear. Other types of arthritis can be related to rotator cuff tears, infection, or an inflammation of the joint lining.\r\n<br/>\r\nOften people will avoid shoulder movements in an attempt to lessen arthritis pain. This sometimes leads to a tightening or stiffening of the soft tissue parts of the joint, resulting in a painful restriction of motion.<br/>'),
(3, 'Chest pain refers to pain felt anywhere in the chest area from the level of your shoulders to the bottom of your ribs. It is a common symptom. There are many causes of chest pain. It can often be difficult to diagnose the exact cause of chest pain without carrying out some tests and investigations.\r\n<br/>\r\nIt is important to take chest pain seriously because it can sometimes indicate a serious underlying problem. Any new, severe, or persisting chest pain should be discussed with your doctor. This is particularly important if you are an adult and have a history of heart or lung disease.<br/>\r\n\r\nThere are many possible causes of chest pain. Below is a brief overview of some of the more common causes.\r\n<br/>\r\n<span id=''heading''>Angina</span>\r\nLike any other muscle in the body, the heart (coronary) muscle needs a good blood supply. The coronary arteries supply blood to the heart muscle.\r\n<br/>\r\nAngina is a pain that comes from the heart. It is usually caused by narrowing of the coronary arteries. This narrowing causes a reduced blood supply to part, or parts, of the heart muscle. The narrowing is caused by fatty patches or plaques (atheroma) which develop within the inside lining of arteries. Plaques of atheroma can form gradually over years. They may be in one or more places in the coronary arteries.\r\n<br/>\r\nThe reduced blood supply to the heart muscle due to atheroma may be good enough when you are resting. However, when your heart works harder (for example, when you are walking fast or climbing the stairs), your heart muscle needs more blood and oxygen. If the extra blood cannot get past the narrowed coronary arteries, your heart responds with pain.\r\n<br/>\r\nThe chest pain caused by angina may feel like an ache, discomfort or tightness across the front of your chest when you exert yourself. Pain may also (or sometimes just) be felt in your arms, neck, jaw or stomach. Angina pain usually eases within 10 minutes when you rest. See separate leaflet called Angina for more details. Angina pain can also occur with coronary artery spasm or cardiac syndrome X.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n<span id=''heading>''Heart attack (myocardial infarction)</span>\r\nDuring a heart attack, a coronary artery or one of its smaller branches is suddenly blocked. This means that the part of the heart muscle supplied by this artery loses its blood and oxygen supply. Unless the blockage is quickly removed, this part of the heart muscle is at risk of dying. A heart attack is often referred to as a myocardial infarction. When part of the heart muscle is damaged, it is said to be infarcted. The term myocardial infarction means damaged heart muscle.\r\n<br/>\r\nThe blockage of the coronary artery during a heart attack is usually caused by a blood clot. A blood clot may form if there is some atheroma within the lining of the artery. A crack can develop in the patch of atheroma and this can trigger the clotting mechanism in the blood to form a blood clot over the patch of atheroma. Treatment with clot-busting medication or a procedure called angioplasty can break up the blood clot. This means that blood flow through the artery can be restored. If this treatment is given quickly, it can prevent damage to the heart muscle or limit the extent of the damage.\r\n<br/>\r\nThe most common symptom of a heart attack is severe chest pain at rest. This often feels like a heavy pressure feeling on your chest. The pain may travel up into your jaw, or down your left arm, or down both arms. You may also sweat, feel sick, feel faint and feel short of breath. The pain may be similar to angina but it is more severe and lasts longer.'),
(4, 'Most people don''t like to talk about it, but having a gastrointestinal problem is common.\r\n<br/>\r\nThere''s no need to suffer in silence. Here''s a top-to-bottom look at nine of the most prevalent digestive conditions, their symptoms, and the most effective treatments available.<br/>\r\n<span id=''heading''>Chest Pain: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)</span>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen stomach acid backs up into your esophagus — a condition called acid reflux — you may feel a burning pain in the middle of your chest. It often occurs after meals or at night, says Neville Bamji, MD, a clinical instructor of medicine at The Mount Sinai Hospital and a gastroenterologist with New York Gastroenterology Associates.\r\n<br/>\r\nWhile it’s common for people to experience acid reflux and heartburn once in a while, having symptoms that affect your daily life or occur at least twice each week could be a sign of GERD, a chronic digestive disease that affects 20 percent of Americans, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). If you experience persistent heartburn, bad breath, tooth erosion, nausea, pain in your chest or upper part of your abdomen, or have trouble swallowing or breathing, see your doctor.\r\n<br/>\r\nMost people find relief by avoiding the foods and beverages that trigger their symptoms and/or by taking over-the-counter antacids or other medications that reduce stomach acid production and inflammation of the esophagus; however, some cases of GERD require stronger treatment, such as medication or surgery.<br/>'),
(5, 'Pain in the legs can occur as a result of conditions that affect bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, nerves, or skin. Leg pain can occur in the foot, ankle, knee, behind the knee, thigh, down the back of the leg, or in any part of the leg. It can occur at night, while lying down, or while running or exercising, depending upon the cause. Typically, the leg pain is a result of tissue inflammation that is caused by injury or disease. Either injury or chronic disease can cause inflammation to any of the tissues of the leg and lead to leg pain. Since the leg contains a number of different structures and tissue types, a wide variety of conditions and injuries can cause leg pain. Depending on the cause of the pain, other symptoms, like weakness, numbness, throbbing, cramps, aching, or a tingling sensation, may accompany leg pain. Diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage from diabetes) is a common cause of tingling, burning, and numbness in the legs that can at times be painful. For diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, it is important to differentiate the exact type and location of any pain in the legs. Peripheral artery disease can cause claudication, or pain that occurs in the legs usually when walking or exercising. Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) can be another cause of leg pain. Pain in the knee and ankle joints of the leg is common with the arthritis conditions. The pain of sciatica (from disc disease of the spine) may radiate down the leg and is another common cause of leg pain.'),
(6, 'The location and severity of knee pain may vary, depending on the cause of the problem. Signs and symptoms that sometimes accompany knee pain include:\r\n<br/>\r\n1. Swelling and stiffness<br/>\r\n2. Redness and warmth to the touch<br/>\r\n3. Weakness or instability<br/>\r\n4. Popping or crunching noises<br/>\r\n5. Inability to fully straighten the knee<br/>\r\nKnee pain can be caused by injuries, mechanical problems, types of arthritis and other problems.\r\n\r\n<span id=''heading''>Injuries</span>\r\n\r\nA knee injury can affect any of the ligaments, tendons or fluid-filled sacs (bursae) that surround your knee joint as well as the bones, cartilage and ligaments that form the joint itself.<br/>\r\nPatellofemoral pain syndrome is a general term that refers to pain arising between your patella and the underlying thighbone (femur). It''s common in athletes; in young adults, especially those who have a slight maltracking of the kneecap; and in older adults, who usually develop the condition as a result of arthritis of the kneecap'),
(7, 'What is causing soreness in your lower leg? The muscles of the lower leg control foot motion and stability, so increase in activity or changes in footwear can sometimes cause sore muscles or tendonitis. While the increase in physical activity is a leading cause of lower leg pain, there are many other health conditions that can cause leg pain.\r\n<br/>\r\nLeg pain that is severe, sudden, or accompanied by swelling should always be evaluated by a physician. Some of the more common causes of lower leg pain include:<br/>\r\n<span id=''heading''>1. Muscle Strain or Fatigue</span><br/>\r\nMuscle fatigue or strain is the most common cause of leg soreness. Usually, a muscle strain happens from increased activity and causes a minimal amount of soreness. The soreness is easily relieved by rest and cold or warm compresses. However, sudden or severe injuries can cause a muscle tear or tendon rupture which is significantly more painful. The gastrocnemius muscle of the calf is a common area for strain and tear. Stretching prior to exercise may help decrease the chance of muscle injury.<br/><br/>\r\n<span id=''heading''>2. Exercise-Related Injuries</span><br/>\r\nShin splints, also known as medial tibial stress syndrome, is a common exercise-related injury. Shin splints often affect runners and those involved in sprinting or jumping sports. The pain is felt along the inside (medial) and back (posterior) part of the tibia bone where the calf muscles attach to the bone. Shin splints may be aggravated or triggered by foot conditions such as over-pronation or high-arched feet. A stress fracture of the tibia bone is another condition seen in running and jumping sports and like shin splints, causes leg pain with activity. A less common cause of exercise-related leg pain is exercise-induced compartment syndrome. This condition is more often associated with a recent increase in leg muscle mass and causes intense leg pain, cramping, and a tight feeling in the leg muscles with activity.<br/><br/>\r\n<span id=''heading''>3. Tendonitis in the Lower Leg</span><br/>\r\nTendonitis is a common sports overuse injury but can strike anyone, regardless of activity levels. Tendonitis is inflammation surrounding a tendon, which is a strong, cord-like structure that anchors a muscle to bone. Abnormalities in foot structure such as flat feet or high arches can trigger tendonitis. Tendonitis presents as pain that increases with activity or stretching of the affected tendon. Common types of tendonitis that would cause lower leg pain around the ankle area are Achilles tendonitis and posterior tibial tendonitis.\r\n'),
(8, 'Pain in the neck can be more than just a hassle. Neck pain can come from disorders and diseases of any structure in the neck. There are seven vertebrae that are the bony building blocks of the spine in the neck (the cervical vertebrae) that surround the spinal cord and canal. Between these vertebrae are discs and nearby pass the nerves of the neck. Within the neck, structures include the neck muscles, arteries, veins, lymph glands, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, esophagus, larynx, and trachea. Disease of any of these structures can lead to neck pain.\r\n<br/>\r\nNeck pain is medically referred to as cervicalgia.\r\n<br/>\r\nNeck pain can be associated with\r\n<br/>\r\n1. headaches<br/>\r\n2. tingling in the arms<br/>\r\n3. muscle pain<br/>\r\n4. fever<br/>\r\n5. stiff neck<br/>\r\n6. throat pain<br/>\r\n7. tenderness<br/>\r\n8. weakness of the arms<br/><br/>\r\nTypes and causes of neck pain include:\r\n<br/>\r\n<span id=''heading''>Nonspecific neck pain</span>\r\nThis is the most common type. This is sometimes called ''simple'' or ''mechanical'' neck pain. Often the exact cause or origin of the pain is not known. It may include minor strains and sprains to muscles or ligaments in the neck. Bad posture may also be a contributing factor in some cases. For example, neck pain is more common in people who spend much of their working day at a desk, with a ''bent-forward'' posture.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n<span id=''heading>''A ''whiplash'' jolt to the neck</span>\r\nThis is most commonly due to an accident involving a vehicle, such as a car crash. It can cause neck pain. See separate leaflet called Whiplash Neck Sprain for more details.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<span id=''heading''>Sudden-onset (acute) torticollis</span>\r\nThis is sometimes called ''wry neck''. A torticollis is a condition in which the head becomes twisted to one side and it is very painful to move the head back straight. The cause of acute primary torticollis is often not known.'),
(9, '<span id=''heading''>Brain Tumors</span>\r\nSometimes, tumors form in the brain and can be very dangerous. These are called primary brain tumors. In other cases, cancer somewhere else in your body spreads to your brain. These are called secondary or metastatic brain tumors.\r\n<br/>\r\nBrain tumors can be either malignant (cancerous) or benign (noncancerous). Doctors classify brain tumors as grades 1, 2, 3, or 4. Higher numbers indicate more aggressive tumors. The cause of brain tumors is largely unknown. They can occur in people of any age.\r\n\r\nSymptoms of brain tumors depend on the size and location of the tumor. The most common symptoms of brain tumors are:\r\n<br/>\r\n1. headaches<br/>\r\n2. seizures<br/>\r\n3. numbness or tingling in your arms or legs<br/>\r\n4. nausea<br/>\r\n5. vomiting<br/>\r\n6. changes in personality<br/>\r\n7. difficulty with movement or balance\r\nchanges in your hearing, speech, or vision<br/>\r\nThe type of treatment you’ll receive depends on many different factors, such as the size of the tumor and your age and overall health. The main types of treatment for brain tumors are surgery, chemotherapy (medication), and radiation therapy.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<span id=''heading''>Neurodegenerative Diseases</span>\r\nNeurodegenerative diseases cause your brain and nerves to deteriorate over time. They can change your personality and cause confusion. They can also destroy your brain’s tissue and nerves.\r\n<br/>\r\nSome brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, may develop as you age. They can slowly impair your memory and thought processes. Other diseases, such as Tay-Sachs disease, are genetic and begin at an early age. Other common neurodegenerative diseases include:\r\n<br/>\r\n1. Huntington’s disease<br/>\r\n2. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis<br/>\r\n3. Parkinson’s disease<br/>\r\n4. all forms of dementia<br/>\r\nSome of the more common symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases include:\r\n<br/>\r\n1. Memory loss<br/>\r\n2. Forgetfulness<br/>\r\n3. Apathy<br/>\r\n4. Anxiety<br/>\r\n5. Agitation<br/>\r\n6. A loss of inhibition<br/>\r\n7. Mood changes<br/>\r\nNeurodegenerative diseases cause permanent damage, so symptoms tend to get worse as the disease progresses. New symptoms are also likely to develop over time.\r\n<br/>\r\nThere''s no cure for neurodegenerative diseases, but treatment can still help. Treatment for these diseases tries to reduce symptoms and maintain quality of life. Treatment often involves the use of medications to control symptoms.');
